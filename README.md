## Brief
This project is an implementation of a 2D graphics package in C++. It provides various functionalities for drawing and manipulating shapes using object-oriented programming principles. The package supports the following features:

- Changing the background of the window to white
- Modifying the shape of the window mouse
- Interacting with the window using only the mouse
- Combining the console and window functionalities
- Choosing the shape color before drawing from the menu
- Clearing the screen from shapes
- Saving the data in the screen to a file
- Loading data from files
- Implementing line algorithms (DDA, Midpoint, and parametric)
- Implementing circle algorithms (Direct, Polar, Iterative Polar, Midpoint, and Modified Midpoint)
- Filling a circle with lines after selecting a filling quarter from the user
- Filling a circle with other circles after selecting a filling quarter from the user
- Filling a square with a Hermit Curve (Vertical)
- Filling a rectangle with a Bezier Curve (Horizontal)
- Convex and Non-Convex Filling Algorithm
- Recursive and Non-Recursive Flood Fill
- Cardinal Spline Curve
- Ellipse Algorithms (Direct, Polar, and Midpoint)
- Clipping algorithms using a rectangle or square as a Clipping Window (Point, Line, Polygon)

## Getting Started
